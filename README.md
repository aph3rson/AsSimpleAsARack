# As Simple As A Rack (Continued)

Adds Storage racks and refridgerated storage racks.
Things in the racks will not deteriorate when placed outside.
Normal racks need Smithing-research, refridgerated also needs Air-Conditioning.
The racks can be used to hold up a roof.

Note: You need to put this mod after Rimfrigde in mod order
